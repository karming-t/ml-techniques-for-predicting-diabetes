# Machine Learning Ensemble Techniques for Prediction of Diabetes

**A study done to evaluate the performance of base and ensemble machine learning methods on the prediction of diabetes for the Behavioral Risk Surveillance System 2015 dataset**


The raw dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system/data?select=2015.csv)

_"featured_unclean.xlsx"_ contains feature data that are known factors that contribute to diabetes. These features were chosen based on several studies on Type 1 and 2 diabetes. The data here however, is not cleaned.

_"resolved_nan.xlsx"_ contains cleaned featured data where rows with missing values and target variable classes that relates to gestational and pre/borderline diabetes were removed as this study only refers to strictly diagnosed Type 1 or 2 diabetes.
